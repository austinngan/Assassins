RULES

1) To kill your target, touch them directly (on the skin) with a plastic spoon, available in the cafeteria. Please be gentle.

2) If you see that somebody is about to kill you, you can say "assassin" and you will be immune from your killer until the next day.  Do not abuse this power. If you start saying "assassin" to every person you pass by, you will be disqualified. Also, in cases where there is a dispute about whether the assassin touched the target with the spoon first or the target said "assassin" first, tie goes to the offense. With other disputes, message Joan

3) Safe Zones: You cannot kill during class, after school, at practice, or in the bathrooms (that's gross). Anywhere else is fair game.

4) This game has not been approved by the school. Be quiet about your kills and do NOT start yelling and chasing each other down the hallways. If a teacher asks what you're doing, you MUST disavow any relationship to us.

5) If you are killed or kill somebody, email FILL OUT THE KILL FORM YOU WERE EMAILED 

6) When you kill somebody, whoever they had as a target is your new target. You can kill multiple people in a day but you must keep us up to date on who you've killed every night.  

7) Prizes will be given to the last man and woman standing, and the player with the most kills.
